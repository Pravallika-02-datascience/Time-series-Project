Project Title: Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA and Prophet
Description:
This project demonstrates a simple but effective time series forecasting workflow using both classical (ARIMA) and modern (Facebook Prophet) models on a dataset of airline passenger numbers over time. The goal is to understand time series patterns and build predictive models.

üîç Problem Statement:
Forecast future airline passenger traffic using historical monthly data. The project explores:
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Stationarity testing
Time series decomposition
Forecasting with ARIMA and Prophet
Performance evaluation using RMSE

üß† Algorithms Used:
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average): A statistical method for modeling time series data.
Prophet (by Facebook): A modular forecasting model that handles seasonality and trend shifts easily.

üìä Dataset:
Source: AirPassengers dataset (available in most time series libraries or can be downloaded as CSV)
Attributes:
Month: Date in "YYYY-MM" format
#Passengers: Number of passengers in that month

‚öôÔ∏è Dependencies:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib, seaborn
statsmodels
pmdarima
prophet
scikit-learn

üß™ Steps Followed
1. Data Preprocessing
Loaded the dataset and parsed the Month column as datetime
Set Month as the index for time series compatibility
Checked for missing values and data types

2. Exploratory Data Analysis
Line plot of passenger trends over time
Seasonal and trend decomposition using moving averages
Heatmaps and boxplots (optional) to view monthly and yearly patterns

3. Stationarity Check
Applied Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test
Differenced the data until stationarity was achieved

4. Model 1: ARIMA
Used auto_arima to automatically determine (p, d, q)
Trained ARIMA model on training data
Forecasted future passenger numbers
Plotted predictions vs. actuals
Evaluated using RMSE

5. Model 2: Prophet
Renamed columns as expected by Prophet (ds, y)
Fit Prophet model with daily seasonality = False
Forecasted future data points for the next 36 months
Visualized components: Trend, Weekly & Yearly Seasonality
Compared with ARIMA predictions

üìå Challenges Faced
Stationarity handling: ARIMA requires strict stationarity; applied differencing and transformations.
Model tuning: Finding optimal (p,d,q) for ARIMA without overfitting.
Prophet formatting: Prophet expects specific column names (ds, y).
Visualization interpretation: Ensuring clear plots for trend, seasonal, and residual analysis.

‚úÖ Results
Successfully forecasted passenger numbers for the next 3 years.
Both models provided good accuracy, but Prophet was easier to implement and visualize.
Seasonal peaks and annual trends were captured well by both models.
Prophet provided more explainable decomposition.


üí° Conclusion
This project showcases how classical and modern time series forecasting models can be applied on real-world data. Prophet offers a user-friendly alternative to ARIMA with built-in features for trend/seasonality decomposition and visualization.

üöÄ Future Improvements
Add SARIMA model for seasonal ARIMA forecasting
Tune Prophet with custom holidays/events
Automate RMSE/MAE evaluations across time splits
Deploy as a forecasting web app using Streamlit
